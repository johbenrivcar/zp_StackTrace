'// The log class implements the singleton for publishing messages generated from
'// tracers to an output stream of events. Optionally, messages may also be written
'// to the debug (immediate) window.
'// To use the log to obtain messages, create a reference to it using the WithEvents
'// syntax and intercept the msg(pMsg) events generated by the application

'// Event containing trace message
Public Event msg(pmsg As String)

'// Flag indicating if output should be sent to the debug window
Public sendToDebug As Boolean

'// Function called by the core module to raise the event.
Public Sub msgOut(pmsg As String)
    RaiseEvent msg(pmsg)
    If sendToDebug Then Debug.Print pmsg

'// Do not send to debug, by default
